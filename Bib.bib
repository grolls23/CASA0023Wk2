	shorttitle = {Night-Time Light Data},
	abstract = {Much research has suggested that night-time light ({NTL}) can be used as a proxy for a number of variables, including urbanization, density, and economic growth. As governments around the world either collect census data infrequently or are scaling back the amount of detail collected, alternate sources of population and economic information like {NTL} are being considered. But, just how close is the statistical relationship between {NTL} and economic activity at a fine-grained geographical level? This paper uses a combination of correlation analysis and geographically weighted regressions in order to examine if light can function as a proxy for economic activities at a finer level. We use a fine-grained geo-coded residential and industrial full sample micro-data set for Sweden, and match it with both radiance and saturated light emissions. We find that the correlation between {NTL} and economic activity is strong enough to make it a relatively good proxy for population and establishment density, but the correlation is weaker in relation to wages. In general, we find a stronger relation between light and density values, than with light and total values. We also find a closer connection between radiance light and economic activity, than with saturated light. Further, we find the link between light and economic activity, especially estimated by wages, to be slightly overestimated in large urban areas and underestimated in rural areas.},

	abstract = {The use of active fire detections for direct burned area mapping has been limited by the coarse spatial resolution and long revisit cycles of previous sensors. However, the recently developed {VIIRS} 375m active fire detection product offers enhanced spatial resolution and temporal revisit cycle, and high sensitivity to small active fires. In this study, we apply that product and assess its performance for direct burned area estimation. Consecutive {VIIRS} 375m active fire detections were aggregated to produce the {VIIRS} 375m burned area ({BA}) estimation over ten ecologically diverse study areas. The accuracy of the burned area estimations was assessed by comparison with Landsat-8 supervised burned area classification. The performance of the {VIIRS} 375m {BA} estimates was dependent on the ecosystem characteristics and fire behavior. Higher accuracy was observed in forested areas characterized by large long-duration fires, while grasslands, savannas and agricultural areas showed the highest omission and commission errors. {VIIRS} 375m data proved to have higher sensitivity to small fires and higher fire detection rates compared to previous studies, indicating good potential as a complementary dataset for use in routine burned area mapping systems based on cumulative fire count or seeding of spectral signature approaches. Results from the application of {VIIRS} 375m fire data to directly monitor the growth of long-lasting wildfires using the 2013 Rim Fire example in California showed high agreement with available fine resolution airborne data, therefore serving as an alternative source of information for near real-time mapping of fire-affected areas.},

It takes issue with theories of globalization which argue that global economic activity is being more widely decentralized—‘the world is flat’. We use a global dataset of night-time light emissions to produce an objectively consistent set of mega-regions for the globe. We draw on high-resolution population data to estimate the population of each of these regions. We then process the light data in combination with national gross domestic product ({GDP}) to produce rough but useful regional estimates of economic activity. We also present estimates of technological and scientific innovation.},
